     *  You’ve stumbled upon a haunted house with a mysterious, locked door.
     *  To enter, you need to guess the secret door code between 1 and 50.
     *  Be careful—each incorrect guess releases a spooky sound!

    //Requirements:
    //
    //The program generates a random "door code" between 1 and 50.
    //The user must guess the code to unlock the haunted door.
    //For each incorrect guess, the program should:
    //Tell the user if the guess is too high or too low.
    //Display a spooky message, like “You hear a ghostly whisper...” or “A cold breeze chills you to the bone…”
    //If the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates them and tells them the door has unlocked.
    //The game continues until the correct guess is made.

        /**
         * Class and Filename:
         * In Java, every program starts with something called a class,
         * and the name of the class must be the same as the name of the file.
         * For example, if the class is named Base, you should save the file as Base.java.
         *
         * Uppercase Class Names:
         * The class name always starts with an uppercase letter.
         * So, Base is correct, but base is not.
         * Remember, Java cares about uppercase and lowercase letters, so MyClass and myclass are different!
         *
         * The Main Method:
         * Every Java program has a special part called the main method,
         * which looks like this: public static void main(String[] args).
         * This is where the code runs.

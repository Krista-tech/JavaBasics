/**
 * What is OOP in Java?
 *
 * ðŸ§  Concept Overview
 * OOP = Object-Oriented Programming
 * Java is built on the OOP paradigm, which helps us organize code like the real world.
 *
 * Four Pillars of OOP:
 *
 * | Concept	         | Description
 * |_______________________________________________________________________________
 * | Encapsulation	     | Hides internal details and only exposes necessary parts.
 * | Inheritance	     | Allows reuse of code between classes.
 * | Polymorphism	     | Allows different behaviors with the same interface.
 * | Abstraction	     | Hides complex logic, shows only essential features.
 * |_______________________________________________________________________________
 *
 *
 * ðŸ“Œ Example Analogy: A Car object:
 *
 *  Has data: color, speed, brand
 *  Has actions: drive(), brake(), start()
 *  Just like in real life â€” we interact with objects that have properties and behaviors.
 *

 * ðŸ“š What is Recursion?
 *
 * Recursion is when a method calls itself.
 * It helps us solve big problems by breaking them into smaller parts.
 *
 * Example: ðŸª† Nesting dolls, ðŸ“‚ folders inside folders, ðŸªœ climbing stairs.
 *
 * âœ… Why Do We Use Recursion?
 * Imagine youâ€™re solving a big puzzle. Instead of solving it all at once,
 * you break it into smaller puzzles â€” and keep going until itâ€™s easy!
 * Recursion helps us do that in code!
 *
 * ðŸ§  Simple Explanation:
 * We use recursion when a problem is made of smaller versions of the same problem.
 *
 * It helps when:
 * - We donâ€™t know how many steps itâ€™ll take (like solving a maze)
 * - We want the computer to remember what it did before
 * - The problem keeps repeating itself (like counting, searching, drawing)
 *
 * ðŸ§© Real-world Kid-Friendly Uses:
 * - Solving mazes (try every path until you find the way out)
 * - Making Fibonacci numbers (each number made from two before it)
 * - Drawing fractals or snowflakes (patterns inside patterns)
 * - Playing Tower of Hanoi (moving disks step by step)
 * - Looking inside folders or game levels (folders in folders)
 *
 * ðŸ’» Why Not Just Use Loops?
 * Loops (for, while) are great when we know how many times we need to repeat.
 *
 * But recursion is better when:
 * - We donâ€™t know how many times it repeats
 * - The task is shaped like a tree, puzzle, or folder system
 * - We want the code to be cleaner and shorter
 *
 * ðŸ¤– Why Itâ€™s Useful in the Real World:
 * - Searching files inside folders
 * - Doing math like combinations or splitting numbers
 * - Drawing things in games (trees, buildings, waves)
 * - Teaching game characters to make decisions (yes/no logic)
 * - Reading tricky text like HTML or equations

/**
 * 💡hat is Polymorphism?
 * Polymorphism means “many forms.” It lets different classes use the same method name, but they can each do something in their own way.
 *
 * 🐾 Real-Life Example:
 * Imagine you say “speak!” to different animals:
 *
 * A cat says “Meow”
 * A dog says “Woof”
 * A parrot might say “Hello!”
 *
 * They all respond to the same command (speak()), but each one sounds different. That’s polymorphism!
 *
 * 📘 How it works in Java:
 * We use a superclass with a method (e.g., speak())
 * Each subclass overrides the method to do its own thing

public class Main {

    // TASK 1: Create an array of Instrument objects
    // Add a Guitar, Drum, and Flute to the array
    // Set names for each one

    // TASK 2: Call a method called playAll(Instrument[] instruments)
    // This should call play() on each one

    // TASK 3: BONUS — Let the user choose instrument names with Scanner
    // Then create the instruments and play them

    // TASK 4: EXTRA — Try calling Guitar's play() on an Instrument object
    // It should still work — this shows the power of polymorphism!

    // Step 5: After playing all instruments,
    // count how many of each type were in the concert
    // Example Output:
    // Guitar 1 goes strum strum!
    // Drum 2 goes boom boom!
    // Flute 3 plays a soft melody...
    //
    // Total: 4 Guitars, 3 Drums, 3 Flutes

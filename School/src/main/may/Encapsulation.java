 * ðŸ’¡ What is Encapsulation?
 * Encapsulation is like having a secret box inside your class.
 *
 * You keep your important stuff (like your password or how much money you have) hidden so no one can change it by accident.
 * Instead of letting anyone open the box,
 * you give them special buttons (these are your methods!) to use if they want to:
 *
 * Check what's inside
 * Change something the safe way
 * This helps keep your code safe and tidy, just like keeping your toys in boxes with labels.
 *
 *
 * ðŸ’­ Real-Life Example:
 * Imagine you have a piggy bank.
 *
 * You canâ€™t reach in and take money directly.
 * You press a button to check the balance, and another button to add coins.
 *
 * Thatâ€™s how encapsulation works!

         * Collecting Stars
         *

         * Create a program where the user collects stars until they have 10 stars.
         * The program will use a while loop to track and display progress.

        //Task Requirements:
        //
        //Start with 0 stars.
        //Each time the user inputs a number of stars collected (e.g., 1, 2, 3), add it to the total.
        //Use a do while loop to continue asking for input until the total number of stars reaches 10 or more.
        //Display messages to show the number of stars collected after each input.
        //When the user reaches 10 stars, display a congratulatory message and exit the loop.

        //Output example:
        //You need 10 stars to win!
        //How many stars did you collect? 2
        //You now have 2 stars.
        //How many stars did you collect? 4
        //You now have 6 stars.
        //How many stars did you collect? 5
        //You now have 11 stars.
        //Congratulations! You collected 10 stars!


        //TODO take the code from WhileLoopTask.java and change the while loop to do while loop
        //Hint: do { } while (condition);
